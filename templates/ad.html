      <div>
	<p>The Computational Cognitive Science Group at the University
	of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) is looking for online
	participants for a brief experiment on how people reason about
	objects.</p>

	<p>In this experiment you will be shown pairs of images, and
	you will judge whether they depict the same object. You will
	complete 210 trials, which typically takes between 15 and 20
	minutes.</p>

	<p>The requirements are:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>You are at least 18 years old,</li>
	  <li>You have normal vision or wear corrective lenses, and</li>
	  <li>You are a fluent English speaker.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Note: the experiment will only work in recent browsers, and
	may have difficulty loading on slower connections.</p>

	<p>This task can only be completed once. If you have already
	completed this task before the system will not allow you to
	run again. If this looks familiar please release the hit so
	someone else can participate.</p>

	Otherwise, please click the "Accept Hit" button on the Amazon
	site above to begin the task.
