          <p>This research is being conducted by Prof. Thomas
          Griffiths, a faculty member at the University of California
          at Berkeley. Prof. Griffiths' lab investigates computational
          models of human cognition. The study typically takes between
          15 and 20 minutes.</p>

          <p>If you agree to take part in the research, you will fill
          out a brief on-line questionnaire. The questionnaires will
          involve reading information, viewing images, and answering
          questions. All of the information that we obtain during the
          research will be kept confidential, and not associated with
          your name in any way.</p>

          <p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. You are
          free to refuse to take part, and you may stop taking part at
          any time. You are free to discontinue participation in this
          study at any time with no penalty. If there is any question
          in the questionnaire that makes you uncomfortable or that
          you do not want to answer, it is your right to refrain from
          answering that question.</p>

          hesitate to
